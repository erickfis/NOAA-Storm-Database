# NOAA Storm Database - Worst Cases
*erickfis, 2017 maio, 20*


In this study we have analysed the NOAA Storm Database in order to
determine what are the worst natural catastrophic events, both in terms
of public health and in economic impact.

The U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) storm
database tracks characteristics of major storms and weather events in
the United States, including when and where they occur, as well as
estimates of any fatalities, injuries, and property damage.

The database currently contains data from January 1950 to January 2017,
as entered by NOAA's National Weather Service (NWS).

The database can be found on:
